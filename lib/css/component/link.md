# Link

Styling for the `a` tag. Tags without the `ws-x` attribute won't be styled,
while the attribute with no functions will still style it. Links can be
presented as link buttons by adding the `$button` wind function.

## Wind Functions
- $button
    - $outline or $fill (with $button only)
- $color
