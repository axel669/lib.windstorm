# Screen

The screen acts as a wrapper for a paper (or other container) to sit in
and only provides the sizing/centering with the stacking visual effect.
The top level of a page will likely be a screen but it doesnt have to be.

## Wind Functions
- $left<br />
    Left aligns the container in the screen

## Variables
- screen-width<br />
    Defines how wide the screen's contents will be.<br />
    default: min(720px, 100%)
- stack<br />
    Increasing the stack number increases the space surrounding a screen,
    creating a stacking effect when multiple screens are overlayed with
    incrementing stack values.

There will be examples and more docs when I feel like it, I don't know
where I'd begin documenting this.
