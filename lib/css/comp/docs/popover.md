# Popover
It's a popup thing that isn't a modal and is tied to some content for
positioning. Position relative to the element is done using the normal
position values (x, y, -x, -y, inset-x, inset-y).

The child elements not marked with the slot will be the content that is
displayed normally, with the slot defining what content appears in the popover
when it's open.

## Component Macros
