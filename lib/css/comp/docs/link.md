# Link
Styling for the `a` tag. Tags without the `ws-x` attribute won't be styled,
while the attribute with no functions will still style it. Links can be
presented as link buttons by adding the `$button` wind function.

## Markers

### @button
Makes the anchor look and feel like a button.

## Component Macros
- $outline or $fill (with @button only)
- $color
