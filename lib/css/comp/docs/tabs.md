# Tabs
Displays a list of tabs with some default styling. Tabs do not respond to
inputs without JavaScript.

Use the `$tab-selected` macro to show which tab is active.

## Component Macros
- $color
- $solid<br />
    Changes the selected tab to be filled with color instead of just the border.
- $tab-selected<br />
    Does not apply a style of its own, but denotes which tab is selected in a
    group of tabs.
