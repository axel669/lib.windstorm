<h1 id="screen">Screen</h1>
<p>The screen component is primarily made for app pages rather than general
purpose pages like the other components. It can be used to wrap the main
content of a regular page as well, but the visual stacking properties
will only really be seen by using code to add additional screen elements
on top of each other at runtime.</p>
<p>There will be examples and more docs when I feel like it, I don&#39;t know
where I&#39;d begin documenting this.</p>
